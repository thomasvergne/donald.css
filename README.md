It is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). It is a collection of components that can be used in any project that uses both of theses libraries.

The website uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) to generate static pages and [Bun](https://bun.supermaya.io/) to manage the project.

3. Start the development server
